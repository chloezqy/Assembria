# Assembria — Predictive AI for Smarter Auto Assembly

**Assembria** is a speculative design system and interactive prototype that explores how **AI-driven predictive maintenance** can close the gap between customer orders and on-time deliveries in automotive manufacturing.  
It visualizes an intelligent assembly line that detects potential machine failures before they happen — transforming downtime into foresight.
