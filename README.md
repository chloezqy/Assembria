# Assembria — Predictive AI for Smarter Auto Assembly

Assembria is a speculative design system and interactive prototype that explores how **AI-driven predictive maintenance** can close the gap between customer orders and on-time deliveries in automotive manufacturing.
It visualizes an intelligent assembly line that detects potential machine failures before they happen — transforming downtime into foresight.

## Core Screens
1. **Overview Dashboard** – Displays factory health, predictive activity, and issue distribution with a 2.5D assembly line visualization.
2. **Machines Page** – Shows per-machine analytics: sensor trends (temperature, sound, airflow, optical), failure probability, and AI recommendations.
3. **Maintenance Page** – Manages repair scheduling, part procurement, and workforce allocation through an intelligent calendar system.
4. **Analytics Page** – Summarizes performance impact: downtime reduction, ROI, model accuracy, and sensor contribution analysis.

## How It Works

* UI/UX design in **Figma**.
* Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**.
